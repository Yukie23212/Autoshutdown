# Autoshutdown
A simple auto-shutdown script that triggers when idle.

# Requirement
- Python
- pyautogui module

# install 
Ensure Python is installed and in your system's PATH. Then, install the pyautogui module by running:


```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

# How to use
1. Download "Idlemodeshutdown.py".
2. Run the script by double-clicking it. A Python window will open and show the script's status.
3. To adjust the shutdown timer, edit the script using Notepad or any text editor.
4. Keep the Python window open after launching the script; closing it will terminate the process, preventing the script from working.
